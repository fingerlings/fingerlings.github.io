WowWee Fingerlings are designed to last for hours of silly fun. 
Your interactive pet will respond to touch, noise, and being picked up or shaken, but it also is designed to turn off on its own to conserve energy if it is not 
  being played with. 
If your pet is not responding, try turning it off and on again. If it still doesnÂ’t respond or is slow to react, it may need new batteries.
