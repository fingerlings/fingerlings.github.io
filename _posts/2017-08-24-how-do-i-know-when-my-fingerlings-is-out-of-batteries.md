If your Fingerlings pet becomes slow or unresponsive, it may need new batteries. 
First try switching it off, then on again in case it is simply in energy conservation mode. 
If that doesnÂ’t work, power OFF and replace all batteries with fresh ones of the same type (4 x LR44/AG13 button cell batteries).
