Fingerlings are designed to fit a variety of finger sizes. 
Try a different finger like your pinky or your thumb for a better fit.
Fingerlings also love to grib on other objects like your belt loop, a large marker, a laptop screen, and so much more! 
They love playing in the Fingerlings Play Sets as well. 
Wherever you decide to place your Fingerlings, make sure your little pet is safe and holding on tight, since you donÂ’t want them to fall and hurt themselves!
