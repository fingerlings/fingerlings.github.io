Your Fingerling will enter sleep mode after 5 minutes of inactivity.
Flip the power switch off and on again to bring your monkey back to life. 
If that doesnÂ’t work, your toy may need new batteries. Power OFF and replace all batteries with fresh ones of the same type (4 x LR44/AG13 button cell batteries).
