As a first step, please try turning your Fingerlings pet monkey off then on again.
If that doesnÂ’t work, try replacing the batteries with fresh ones of the correct type (4 x LR44/AG13 button cell batteries). 
If your Fingerlings pet is still contact our Customer Service at http://www.wowweezone.com/ for further information about refunds and returns.
