  pageTitle: Some facts on fingerlings.info
  pageText: It all started in august of 2017. Our small crew were out and about, scanning the market for new toys. Little did we know about the toy that would turn the toy-world upside down. When we first saw the adorable tiny little creatures, we knew for sure that it would become a success. Because of all this we felt we were on a mission; tell the world by creating a website about them.
